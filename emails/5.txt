Safe Redaction: an early draft BIP

Hello list, 

I've prepared a draft BIP for community feedback, called Safe Redaction (https://github.com/laissez-faire-btc/safe-redaction/blob/main/bip-safe-redaction.md). It proposes a soft fork that gives node operators the option to redact arbitrary data that they find objectionable, while maintaining the benefits of running a full node.

Please note that I have used BIP 3 for this draft - for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, BIP 3 is likely to be adopted before Safe Redaction, so this is basic future-proofing. Additionally, this may be the first time BIP 3 has been used to draft a new BIP, and so this may add constructive support for the adoption of BIP 3, or highlight issues, or simply help to raise awareness and progress the discussion. 

As described in BIP 3, the purpose of this email is to invite BIP editors and other community members to comment on the proposal, in regard to:

* Novelty of the idea
* Viability, utility, and relevance of the concept
* Readiness of the proposal
* On-topic for the Bitcoin community

Of course, I am also keen to hear any and all thoughts on this proposal, from any perspective. Community interest is a requirement for any new BIP, so if you are interested, please speak up.

If you would like to have a more in-depth conversation than this distribution list can practically support, you are invited to join the Discord server. The latest invite link is in the draft BIP, linked above.

You can also email me details of your preferred mode of private communication, if necessary.

Thank you.

Laissez faire, laissez passer.

Let it be, let it go.
